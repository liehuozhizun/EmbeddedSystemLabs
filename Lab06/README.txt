The most important part in this project is understanding the bit masking and how to manipulate the
value to control the chip board. In addition, the point of this lab was to familarize ourselves with
the IO of the pic32. We were supposed to know how the buttons, switches, and OLEDs actually work and
get expierence on how to manipulate it.

My approach to the lab was to follow the guide that was given by the handout. I was stucked in part 3
for a long time to think how to calculate with those numbers. I also spent plenty of time in part 5 to
understand the logic of the program. 
I think it's better to introduce the information of chip board first, then give the assigment guideline
and directly followed by the sudo-code. Seprating them is not a good idea.

The part I had most difficulty on was part 3 and 5. I had a lot of trouble implementing the Button 
functionality and deal with the extra-credit work.
