The important knowledge we should study and be familiar with is the stack.
The definiation of the stack and how it works with RPN calculation. Another
point is the use of struct and enum. One important coding custom is using
specific error with enum instead of simple "error = 0".

I did the lab with stack first, then stack_test. Next is RNP calculation 
and RPN_test. Then test with the main. I read the manual first to see what
we need to do in this lab and what we should know to do the lab. After that,
I just started to do the lab at once. At the end, I will go back to read the
manual carefully in case I miss anything. Honestly, I didn't check the maunal
word by word but just simply look the title and see what's the improtant
and just start the coding part. I didn't work with others.

It looks good and enhances my understanding of stack, the basic data structure.
Moreover, I practiced my coding skills. I used about 5 hours to do this lab, 
including coding and testing. It didn't take such long time to complete it.
The hardest part should be the details of the implementation. You should be 
very careful on how the program should work and return the correct things.
The lecture is useful.
