1. This lab implements the simple calculation for 3x3 matrix. The most important
part in this lab is to understand how the matrix calculation works in different 
operation. Becasue we do not have access to modify the .h file, a lot of #define
must be included in the .c file which makes the organization mixed.

2. I do this lab function by function. (1) understand the mathematical formulaï¼›
(2) implement the function in MatrixMath.c; (3) design the test cases; (4) test
and debug.
The biggest chanllege is to understand how the 2-dimensional array works as the 
matrix. Then coding is easy for me. I spent plenty of time on understanding the 
formula for MatrixInverse(). I worked alone.

3. I spent about 2 hours on understanding the whole instruction as well as the 
formula, 5 hours on implementation, and 5 hours on designing test cases. 
12 hours in total, may be less. I hate math. :)
