SelectionSort() = 47.29  ms
InsertionSort() = 23.804 ms (faster)
If both sort algorithm are in the best cases, the SelectionSort() has
time complexity O(n^2). However, InsertionSort() only takes O(n) in 
its best case.
It's expected result.

The most important part is thing the edge cases where may cause your
program fail. This is important both in test and coding process.
The tests should be enough to test it out.

I read the manul first to know what the data structure we need to 
implement and then finish the LinkedList.c part and test then.
Finally I wrote the sort.c part and test it to confirm my program on
LinkedList.c is perfect. I worked alone.

I spent about 5 hours for this lab assignment. 2 for coding and 3 for
testing cases. This lab assignment enhances my understanding on linked-
list as well as sort algorithm which is harder than coding itself.
All in all, it's not a difficult assignment.
